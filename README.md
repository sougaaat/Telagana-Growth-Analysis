# Telangana Growth Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This repository contains the datasets, icons, and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file used to develop the Telangana Growth Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. The dashboard provides transparent insights into the economic landscape of Telangana, specifically focusing on e-STAMPS and Transportation data. <br>

This project is a submission for <a href = "https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge">Codebasics Resume Project Challenge</a>. <br>

Here's the dashboard: <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjliZjYxNjUtNTQ5My00ZjgwLThiOTQtYWY0YzkwMjNmNWQ3IiwidCI6IjhlODZjZjVlLTEyNTItNDFhNS1hN2IyLTBmZGJiOTFhMzUyNCJ9"> Telangana Growth Analysis PBIX </a>
## Files and Structure
**Datasets**: The datasets directory contains the raw data used for the analysis, including e-STAMPS revenue, documentation registrations, and transportation statistics. <br>

**Icons**: The icons directory includes the icons used in the Power BI dashboard for visual representation. <br>

**Telangana_Growth_Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file documents the data cleaning, exploration, and transformation processes before importing the data into Power BI. <br>

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard is designed to offer concise insights into key economic indicators, including total revenue, e-STAMPS contributions, and transportation statistics. The dashboard comprises two main sections: e-STAMPS and Transportation.

### e-STAMPS Section
**KPI Cards**: Overview of total districts, document registration revenue, e-STAMPS revenue, and current month statistics. <br>

**Charts**: Stacked horizontal bar chart for overall revenue by districts, donut chart for top 5 districts by e-STAMPS revenue, area chart for total revenue by year, and a map chart displaying revenue across districts. <br>

### Transportation Section
**KPI Cards**: Summary of total vehicles sold, new and pre-owned vehicles, and a breakdown of transport and non-transport vehicles. <br>

**Charts**: Stacked area chart for monthly vehicle sales, stacked horizontal bar charts for vehicle class segmentation, and transport vs. non-transport vehicles in top 10 districts, donut chart for vehicles sold by fuel type, and a map chart for revenue across districts. <br>

## How to Use
**Datasets**: Download the datasets from the datasets directory. <br>

**Icons**: Access the icons from the icons directory for visual enhancements. <br>

**Telangana_Growth_Analysis.ipynb**: Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for insights into data preprocessing and transformation. <br>

**Metadata**: Refers to the description of each dataset. <br>

**telangana_district_map.json**: Refers to a customer shape map for dashboarding. <br>
